# Germany-Climatology-Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard displays Germany's temperature and precipation data. Data fro this project cam from the World Bank Group's Climate Change Knowledge Portal.

## Introduction
Climate change is a major environmental issue that's facing the world today. Understanding its various aspects is very important in order to address and prevent it from happening. One of the most crucial factors that can be used to track changes in the climate is precipitation and temperature.

## Data Source
The data used in the Power BI dashboard came from the Climate Change Knowledge Portal of the World Bank. Germany's temperature and precipitation data was collected from 1991 to 2020. They were formatted and cleaned using Microsoft Excel before they were imported into the Power BI platform.

## Dashboard Visualizations
The dashboard features various visualizations that let users explore the data collected from Germany regarding precipitation and temperature. The visualizations include:

. line charts that show the annual temperature and precipitation in Germany from 1991-2020. The charts also include trendlines that show the overall trend in temperature and precipitation over this period. 

. A map that displays the annual temperature and precipitation for each state in Germany. Users can hover over each state to see the specific temperature and precipitation values for that state.

. Stacked bar charts that show the average seasonal temperature and precipitation from 1991-2020 by states.

## Conclusion
The Power BI dashboard project allows users to explore the data collected from 1991 to 2020 about Germany's precipitation and temperature. It can help them understand how climate is changing and inform their decisions regarding climate change mitigation.
